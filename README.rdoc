= Posty

Simple geolocation gem that stores the database locally.

= Getting started

 gem install posty

To download mySociety's mirror of the Code-Point Open in WGS84 format, and create a database from it (this takes about 8 minutes for me, and leaves me with a 157M database):

 posty-init -d database.sqlite3

You may also store the database inside your gem by running:

 posty-init -g

Then, in Ruby:

 require 'posty'
 posty = Posty.new('database.sqlite3')
 postcode = posty.postcode('SE1 1EN') # space is optional, as is capitalisation
 
 p postcode.postcode
 p [postcode.latitude, postcode.longitude]
 p postcode.county

If you've stored the database in with the gem, you don't need to specify the location of the database, like so:

 require 'posty'
 posty = Posty.new

To make things even easier, there's a class method too:

 Posty.postcode('SE1 1EN')

= Notes

The table contains the following columns, extracted from the WGS84 edition of Code-Point Open:
  postcode
  quality
  latitude
  longitude
  country
  nhs_region
  nhs_health_authority
  county
  district
  ward

It does not contain eastings and northings.
